# flag-gen

A computational creativity project by Connor Wood (cw668) 

## What is it?

This is a flag generator - it makes partially random flags.

## How does it work?

It takes a 5x5 graph of nodes and draws lines between them controlled by heuristics. It then computes the shape of these lines as vectors and displays them on a html canvas (using some fancy algorithms) before colouring them (using yet some more fancy algorithms)

## info
This is the most difficult solo project I've undertaken to date, to make it harder on myself I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn Vim and also delve futher into typescript - a relatively untouched language for me.

I don't believe in chad gpt.
